Software Engineer, focused, disciplined and consistent cybersecurity enthusiast looking for his first opportunity.

My current goal is to find my first opportunity in the technology market, not necessarily in the cybersecurity sector, but having the possibility of learning regardless of the area is something I will not refuse.

I'm familiar with some programming languages, mainly web and mobile development, currently focusing my studies on cybersecurity and Python.

As a professional, I'm always looking to apply what I've learned, as well as developing it by passing it on to others or learning new skills.
